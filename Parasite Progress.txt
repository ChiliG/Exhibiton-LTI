Parasite Progress

* Met with alex and discussed possible options for project. Decided to start tracking through github*

*Exhibiton project has been scrapped. We are now just doing the LTI. I will likely seperate my LTI away from my exhibition topic and focus on using github to manage projects for the LTI. This repo will stay dedicated to exhibition progress

Met with alex and discussed the seperation of LTi and exhibition. Discussed using github for LTI. After this push this repo will just be exhibition progress. I may create another repo for LTI progress or just merge the 2 later. I will set a time line using issues to track the completion of the exhibition on this repo.*
