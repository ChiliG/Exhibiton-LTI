LTI Project Progress **

*Created the seperate .txt file for LTI progress. Still working out fine details, but the project should center on github and how it is used, using all of my projects as examples. The bigger project to track will be the calendar project for Alex. Both Fung and Jill think my project will be excellent and I am good to go. As I develop more, more will be posted here.* 2/14/17

*We were given the large LTI project file that has everything needed to complete the project inside it. I am at the project outline stage currently. Issues will be posted to the LTI milestone with all of the stages until completion* 4/4/17

*I have completed all of the check-ins as of now. I haven't kept this log that up to date, but I am nearing the end of the LTI process. Now, all that is left for me is to create a presentation that documents all of my progress here. This will include projects I have worked on for myself and ones I worked on for the team. I have met with fung and even though I don't feel super ready, he thinks it will be good. Once the presentation is done, all I'll have to do is give it, and then its over. I am giving my presentation on June 6th.* 5/25/17
